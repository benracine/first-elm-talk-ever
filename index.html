# An [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) Teaser

##### CSNW Annual Meeting 2015
##### Colorado Springs, CO

[Presentation Source Repo](https://github.com/benracine/first-elm-talk-ever)

# Disclaimer

I am __not lobbying__ for the use of Elm at CSNW in this talk. 

I've done __close to zero research__ regarding its production readiness.

I expect there are important pieces missing from its ecosystem.

I think its design gives rise to **very interesting development patterns**.

# My Path to Elm

My thoughts bounce around in this space in response to two other talks:

- You _might_ recall a talk by LC regarding his "long lost brother", [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/), and his inspiring interactive design ideas.

- A talk at OSCON by Jan Paul Posma about ["Visualizing Program Execution"](http://www.oscon.com/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/42069). Associated search term -> __"Omniscient Debugging"__.

As I ruminate about the treatment of time, the [hot swapping of code](https://vimeo.com/86664303), maintainability, and ease of testing... I've felt a pull towards taking __immutable data__ and __pure stateless functions__ to their logical extremes.

I see Elm as a useful tool for exploration in this direction.

# The "Time Traveling Debugger"

An interesting tool reminiscent of Bret Victor's interactive ideal.

Purity and immutability and their role in <a href="http://debug.elm-lang.org/" target="_blank">its implementation</a>.

A useful <a href="http://elm-lang.org/blog/time-travel-made-easy" target="_blank">blog entry</a>, but this is probably best exhibited by example...

# Show Me the Code!

[foldp](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/2.1.0/Signal) ([simplest possible example](http://elm-lang.org/examples/mouse-clicks)) is (often) super central to understanding Elm code and appears in several examples:

- [Adventure](http://elm-lang.org/examples/adventure): `Signal.foldp update hero input`
- [Mario](http://elm-lang.org/examples/mario):         `Signal.foldp update mario input`
- [Pong](http://elm-lang.org/examples/pong):           `Signal.foldp update defaultGame input`

[Adventure](http://elm-lang.org/examples/adventure) is an example that I hope makes a reasonable entry point.

# Lifelong Learning

I still have MUCH to learn, symmetries to understand, mental analogies to form, and dots to connect between the [FRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) approach and the imperative event-driven approach.

I don't think the MVC bits are (extremely) tricky to understand, but thinking in [signals](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/2.1.0/Signal) vs. events takes some getting used to, and I'm still _not really_ sure how I feel about the pros and cons yet.

I'm intrigued by a possible symbiotic relationship between learning these client-side techniques and in learning server-side concurrency models with some shared functional semantics.

# Background Bits

- Long story made really short... it's "kinda sorta" like [Haskell](haskell.org) in the browser.

- It's a playground of sorts for exploring [FRP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) (Functional Reactive Programming) principles in the browser.

- I can't help but to be tempted to think that it might be [MVC "done right"](http://computationallyendowed.com/blog/2014/07/20/reactive-mvc.html), as it's the first system I've seen where it's super obvious that:

  - The __Model__ is a truly __logicless__ data type that describes the entire state of the application, all in one place. While bits of state may be strewn about the application, the model is the authoritative record of state.

  - The __View__ is just a function that maps a Model to a visual representation, e.g.  __`View : Model -> Element`__

  - The __Controller/Update__ is just a function that maps a Signal and a Model to a new Model, e.g.  __`Update: Signal -> Model -> Model`__

# Almost Random

There's an [elm-d3](https://github.com/seliopou/elm-d3) library out there.

I created a really silly [little toy](github.com/benracine/functional-purity-toy), just to play around with what "functional purity" looks like in JavaScript. I ended up chaining together some tiny pure functions using `_.chain`, which isn't too unlike what happens in the update function in the adventure example.
